Exercise 1: Advanced Date Manipulation with lubridate
Question 1: Generate a sequence of dates from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2025, spaced by every two months. Extract the year, quarter, and ISO week number for each date

```{r}
#Create the sequence of dates
dates <- seq(ymd("2015-01-01"), ymd("2025-12-31"), by = "2 months")

#Show the year quarter and iso_week_number
date_yqI <- data.frame(
  date = dates,
  year = year(dates),
  quarter = quarter(dates),
  iso_week_number = isoweek(dates)
)
print(date_yqI)
```
